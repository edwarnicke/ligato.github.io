Please note that the content of this repository is currently WORK IN PROGRESS.

The SFC Controller is a Golang implementation of an orchestration module for providing data-plane connectivity for cloud native containers. The containers may be Ligato VPP-agent enabled containers which in turn use VPP based cloud-native Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) or the containers may be application containers communicating via veth interfaces. The VPP Agent is built on top of the CN-Infra platform for developing cloud-native Virtual Network Functions (VNFs).

The SFC Controller supports a wide variety of topologies. The controller can effect connectivity for containers on-host, inter-host and host to external router.
