The Cisco Cloud Native standardization effort aims to advance the state-of-the-art for 
building cloud native applications and services, allowing developers to take full advantage of existing and to-be-developed open source technologies. Cloud native refers to applications or services that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled and micro services-oriented.

Groups involved in this activity are from Service Provider CTO and Business units as well as Cisco CTAO organization. Other Cisco organizations are encouraged to participate and join the community. 

We anticipate that this community will allow Cloud native application developers to practically scale their development. Today this foundational work is resource intensive, requiring teams to assemble a team of experts that can integrate disparate technologies and maintain all of them. This community intends to ease this process for developers and their associated products by driving alignment among technologies and platforms.

The community will create/re-use and drive the adoption of a set of common container technologies driven and informed by technical merit and end user value and that is inspired by web-scale computing. This community seeks to improve the overall developer experience, paving the way for faster code reuse, improved machine efficiency, reduced costs and increases in the overall agility and maintainability of applications.

The community will look at open source in four specific areas:

* Sample containers with implementations for common cloud native stacks.  This includes memory caching, messaging, persistence and other areas 

* Consistent deployment experience for customers by providing deployment tooling that can be customized by the product teams for their usage 

* Container networking deployment procedures and examples of how to operate popular cloud networking technologies including Cisco Contiv and Cisco VPP

* Catalog of devops CI/CD systems that have been implemented at Cisco and can be re-used by the development teams in order to jumpstart CI/CD processes 

In addition, the community site will provide insights into forward looking technologies / research in cloud native areas that may be prevalent in the not too distant future.  

In summary, the community aims to assemble all of these areas / components to address a comprehensive set of container application infrastructure construction and deployment needs.

The community will be responsible for stewardship of the overall program by making the technology accessible and widely adopted. The community will have over-sight by various team members.  

The above charter was adapted from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation [article] (https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2015/06/21/new-cloud-native-computing-foundation-to-drive-alignment-among-container-technologies/)
