# Purpose 
The smartsheet is used to document the various tool choices that teams have made across Cisco.  

The reasons to document the tool choices are: 

* Teams can see what others are doing to help them convergence across businesses 
* Teams can see best practices and contact others for opinions/lessons learned 
* Begin to limit the number of tooling options to aid convergence 
* Identify and highlight any licensing or security concerns 

The spreadsheet is broken into two main areas - infrastructure and devops tools so that the entire process is covered.  

Note the spreadsheed has a column that indicates whether the customer will see that particular tool.  For example, a customer will not see our CI/CD tools but will see a deployed Cassandra database.
