# Goals of Meetup  

* Establish a working community around cloud native including the logistics of how we work together and how we get the teams we all represent involved.  
* We need to understand what teams are doing now in cloud native and their plans for the future 
* We need a venn diagram view of technologies and where the various groups intersect and where they differ.  
* The areas we intersect can provide the benefits of sharing 
* The areas we dont intersect are opportunities to make things available to others for consideration/usage 
* We should not initially spend our time debating whether one technology is better than another for the purpose of mandating people switch - that is not the goal - its more discuss and inform for the basis of decision making where people think changing can accelerate or improve what they are doing
* Generate follow on work items  
* Areas for discussion
1. Base images and containers for cloud infr (Cassandra, etcd,…) 
2. Base templates/sample client libraries with Go/C/Java/Node client clode. Explore code bases that exist from SPVSS. CTO, Sumeet group, mobile,… and see what is best strategy to move forward. Many use Spring boot so how to do common things logging,…  Explore the GO strategy and determine synergies between teams. 					
2. Establish thoughts around cloud native deployments – things like Jenkins/Spinnaker- how do we monitor deployments, standardize for our custoerms, work items,... 				
3. Basic CI/CD systems – whats out there – catalog of them – make them avaiable for re-use / knowledge - any alignment 				
4. Cloud native networking including VPP - what are people using - how we can we help each other
5. Secirity of base images and run time 
6. Other cloud native topics based on agenda discussion
